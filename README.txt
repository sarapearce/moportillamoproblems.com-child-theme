Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to complete the task described below within 1 week of the time you receive it. We hate homework just as much as anyone, but we hate making you write code on a whiteboard in front of us during an interview even more. Your attention to detail and code style from these exercises will give us a good idea as to whether you have the technical skills required for the job.

THE TASK:

Convert the enclosed 'Mockup' file to static HTML / CSS. You may use any of your preferred development and/or imaging software and libraries in doing so. Incorporate any implied behaviors (i.e., link states). If you find any ambiguity in terms of the way the page should function, go with your gut and be prepared to justify your decision if asked. Complete as much of the work as you can within 4 hours total (this does not have to be done in one sitting).

EXTRA CREDIT:

Attach a click event to the 'Talk to us' button in the upper right of the page which presents the user with a plain Javascript confirm prompt that says 'Are you sure you want to talk to us?'. If the user clicks on the 'Cancel' button, the prompt should close. If the user clicks on the 'OK' button, he/she should be redirected to https://microventures.com.
